# PlasmaCell CAD: A Computer-Aided Diagnosis Software Tool for Plasma Cell Recognition and Characterization in Microscopic Images

Detecting and analyzing plasma cells in microscopic images is an important task both in scientific and clinical applications. In this software package, we have developed a pipeline that integrates automatic detection, segmentation, classification, and quantitative analysis of plasma cells and other white blood cells. Utilizing image processing algorithms and deep learning methods, we enable precise and reliable analysis of cell morphology. Furthermore, we provide a user-friendly graphical user interface that facilitates efficient interaction with the software. 

## Installation

To Install the software, run the executable setup file (PlasmaCell-CAD.exe) 

https://www.mediafire.com/file/cw156tu28i4s836/PlasmaCell-CAD.rar/file

## Typical Workflow

 - Load Image
 - Cell Detection, Cell Segmentation, and Cell Labeling
 - Display Cell
 - Cell Type
 - Display Cell Features
 - Cell Counting

 
## Features

- According to our knowledge, this is the first open-source software tool which can segment and characterize plasma cells in microscopic images.
- The presented GUI is user-friendly and efficient, offering a variety of image processing and visualization facilities for medical experts. 
- Validation of the proposed methods has been conducted using both a publicly available dataset as well as a locally collected dataset. 
- Using the circlet transform to generate fewer anchors and determine more correctly the regions of interest for the Mask-RCNN algorithm.
